Description: Use this package to convert an existing corpus of Ecological Metadata Language (EML) documents into table form, plus identify and consolidate re-used metadata elements. Existing metadata can then be imported or migrated into a relational database system with re-usable metadata elements (with "primary keys" hence pkEML).
    This package is developed with the intention to help established LTER sites import their EML corpus into LTER-core-metabase. See https://github.com/lter/LTER-core-metabase. However please use to whatever use you may find, and
